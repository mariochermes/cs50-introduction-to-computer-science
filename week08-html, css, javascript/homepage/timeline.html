            <h3>Genesis</h3>
            <p>In the beginning, there was only chaos and darkness. But from the void emerged a powerful deity, known as
              the Creator. The Creator had the power to shape reality itself, and it was this power that the deity used
              to bring order to the chaos and to create the world of the Ring...</p>

            <p>The Age of Chaos, as the name suggests, was a time of great upheaval and turmoil in the world of The
              Ring. The gods and mortals of the world were still coming to terms with the aftermath of The Old One's
              defeat and the creation of the Mechanism of Ascension...
